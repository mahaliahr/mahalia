<h1>My name is Mahalia</h1>

<h3>My name’s Mahalia (‘ma-hay-lee-yah’)
    I am a designer & creative, currently based in London.
    
    I have a keen interest in the multidisciplinary aspects of design. Particularly in the intersection between physical and digital design & the ways we can solve problems with emerging technology and new processes.
    
    Constantly driven by my curiosity, I always aim to keep an open-minded and user focused approach in my work – ensuring what I create is meaningful, functional and will have a positive impact.</h3>
