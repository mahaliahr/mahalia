  <div class="about-text">
          <p>
            Mahalia <span class="phonetic">('ma-hay-lee-yah')</span> Henry-Richards is an artist and designer fascinated by the interplay between computation and the multi-sensory human experience. 
            Their playful and exploratory approach challenges the traditional divide between physical and digital, pushing the boundaries of space and interaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            With an interdisciplinary background spanning architecture and spatial design, to cartographic and user experience design, Mahalia has worked on diverse projects within the design industry. 
            She was previously a lecturer at the University for the Creative Arts before joining the Creative Computing Institute in 2021.         
          </p>
          <p>
            Mahalia holds an MArch in Design for Performance and Interaction from the Bartlett (UCL) and a BA in Interior Architecture from Nottingham Trent University. 
            Alongside their research and teaching, they are a musician and <a href="https://alias.mm-hr.com/">live-coder</a>, incorporating performance as an intrinsic element of their creative practice.          
          </p>
          <p>
            At the Creative Computing Institute, Mahalia teaches on the MSc Creative Computing program and is currently undertaking a <a href="https://phd.mm-hr.com/">PhD exploring how Generative AI could transform learning and teaching</a> .
            The research uses speculative design to imagine future educational possibilities, advocating for a more ethical and personalised AI, aligned with individual learning journeys.
